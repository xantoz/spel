:MESSAGE "In this world there is a very popular online game where the players"
:MESSAGE "actually are inside the game. This way, people can actually experience"
:MESSAGE "fighting monsters and travelling the world in a fantasy game. However, the"
:MESSAGE "company that developed this popular game had a rather bad debugging team."
:MESSAGE "While you can get inside the game world, the opposite is also possible! The"
:MESSAGE "monsters from the game have therefore escaped to the real world and the"
:MESSAGE "world is in deep trouble! Monsters spawn everywhere, and the situation"
:MESSAGE "seems hopeless! However, the way the game was programmed, it's actually"
:MESSAGE "only necessary to kill the last boss. Killing the last boss would free all"
:MESSAGE "other monsters and stuff from the game and therefore from this world too."
:MESSAGE "You're an experienced player and people have all their hopes on you! Thus"
